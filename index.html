							<p><title_1>报告摘要</title_1>：In this talk, we will examine the problem of collective visual inference across a set of images by exploiting the relations among them. Such relations exist in different forms, including commonly shared text keywords, co-occurrence of different visual entities, spatial geometric constraints, and temporal constraints, to mention a few. We argue that by leveraging such relations, and conduct visual inference collectively across all images, we can achieve better recognition accuracy than separately recognizing each visual entity in each image separately under the conventional visual recognition regime. 
Using semantic inference in online photo collections in social media as a case study, we propose a family of networked latent topic models, dubbed the name Visual Topic Network, for joint semantic inference across a collection of images. Our systematic study reveals that modeling such relations for collective inference can effectively facilitate to learn better visual representations, and hence improve recognition accuracy. I will also briefly discuss the potential application of such networked topic models for the task of inferring intended and perceived perception of images in social media. 
If time permits, I will also briefly introduce some of the other research works I have conducted that are related to collective visual inference. 

<br><title_1>讲者信息</title_1>：Gang Hua is a Senior Research Manager in the Visual Computing Group at Microsoft Research Asia. He was an Associate Professor of Computer Science in Stevens Institute of Technology between 2011 and 2015. He held an Academic Advisor position at IBM T. J. Watson Research Center between 2011 and 2014. He was a visiting researcher at Microsoft Research Asia in Summer 2013, and a Consulting Researcher at Microsoft Research in Summer 2012. Before joining Stevens, he had also worked as full-time Researchers at leading industrial research labs for IBM T. J. Watson Research Center, Nokia Research Center Hollywood, and Microsoft Live Labs Research. He received the Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Northwestern University in 2006. 
His research in computer vision studies the interconnections and synergies among the visual data, the semantic and situated context, and the users in the expanded physical world, which can be categorized into three themes: human centered visual computing, big visual data analytics, and vision based cyber-physical systems. He is the author of more than 100 peer reviewed publications in prestigious international journals and conferences. His research was funded by NSF, NIH, ARO, ONR, Adobe Research, Google Research, Microsoft Research, and NEC Labs. He is the recipient of the 2015 IAPR Young Biometrics Investigator Award. To date, he holds 14 U.S. patents and has more than 10 U.S. patents pending. He is a Senior Member of the IEEE and a life member of the ACM.
